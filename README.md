W.G.-Unity3D-SQLite
===================

SQLite Database code for Unity3D independent version.
This is a working code with a scene example of how to implement it.
It was designed to be SO EASY and READY TO RUN.
But there's some extra works during the build, which is you have to include the database manually into your build source folder.

I didn't use it myself, so please don't expect any support from me.
Why it's here explained below.

The database are written with Database Browser for SQLite (http://sqlitebrowser.org/).
So there's no "create" query.
Only write to change value of existing tables.

Until I really use this, sorry for all the inconvenient. :(

The codes are assembled from all around the internet.
Some don't even put names to be credited here.
Make it worst, this codes are from the year early 2014 and I lost all the references to it.
But I always got requests for this through emails, and sometimes I reply very late, thus why it's here.
For the convenient of users.


Best regards,
